## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

This command is used to compile the application and launch a development server that serves the application. By
default, the development server will run on http://localhost:8000.

Changes can quickly be seen in the browser without having to rebuild and deploy the application. It watches for code
changes and rebuilds and updates the browser automatically.

### `yarn lint`

Runs the ESLint tool. Analyzes the code and reports any issues according to the rules and configuration defined
in `.eslintrc`.

Code will not be modified, but it will output a list of warnings and errors to the console.

### `yarn lint:fix`

Automatically attempts to fix any issues that can be automatically corrected according to the rules and configuration
defined in `.eslintrc`.

Not all issues can be automatically fixed by ESLint, and some issues may require manual correction. Remaining warnings
and errors will be output to the console.

### `yarn build`

This command is used to perform a production-ready build of the application by compiling the code, optimizing assets,
and creating an output directory that can be deployed to a server. By default, the output directory for the production
build is `public/`.

### `yarn serve`

Serves the production build of the site for testing prior to deployment. Should be run from the project root.

### `yarn typecheck`

Running `tsc` locally will compile the closest project defined by a tsconfig.json, you can compile a set of TypeScript
files by passing in a glob of files you want.

## GitHub Actions

**For now**, the site is built and deployed on https://matlock-raft-event.github.io/raft-event-app/ every time there is a push to
the `main` branch.

This can eventually be moved to https://matlockraftevent.co.uk.

## ESLint

[ESLint](https://eslint.org) statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. Many problems ESLint finds can be
automatically fixed.

To display lint errors in the console, the linting tool can be run using `yarn lint`

To scan the code for linting errors and automatically fix any that can be resolved, run `yarn lint:fix`

The ESLint setup extends the recommended rules
from [eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb). Overrides and added
ESLint rules can be found in `.eslintrc`.
Files ignored by ESLint can be found in `.eslintignore`.

## Adding fonts

[Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/fonts) is a project to provide open source fonts from Google Fonts as NPM Packages.
You can decrease your siteâ€™s loading time by self-hosting fonts, saving ~300 milliseconds on desktop to 1+ seconds on 3G
connections.

#### This example shows how to install the Montserrat font. If you have a different Google Font you want to use, you can find the corresponding package in NPM or the Fontsource Font Preview Website.

1. Run `yarn add @fontsource/montserrat` to install the necessary package files.
2. Then within **gatsby-browser.js**, import the font package.
   ```js
   import "@fontsource/montserrat" // Defaults to weight 400 with normal variant.
   ```
   If you wish to select a particular weight or style, you may specify it by changing the import path.
   ```js
   import "@fontsource/montserrat/500.css" // Weight 500.
   import "@fontsource/montserrat/900-normal.css" // Select either normal or italic.
   ```
3. Once itâ€™s imported, you can reference the font name in a CSS stylesheet, CSS Module, or CSS-in-JS.
   ```css
   body {
    font-family: "Montserrat", sans-serif;
   }
   ```
